# ContinuousIntegration_CalcLib 
A barebones calculator library in Python that I used to learn Continuous Integration through Circle CI and Github Actions.  Runs unit tests and linting on pushes and pull requests, and publishes an image to Dockerhub when a Pull Request is successfully merged into main.
